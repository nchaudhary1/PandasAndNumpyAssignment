# PandasAndNumpyAssignment
Goal
01 Numpy
Manipulating Data With Numpy
Using the Numpy library for python to deal with data manipulation. Numpy has arrays which are very effective to help deal with data. Numpy's main purpose is for linear algebra. Any kind of data preprocessing can be done in Numpy. Here's what you'll learn in the notebook.

Introduction to NumPy
NumPy Object Creation
Matrix Creation
Indexing and Slicing
Vectorization
Broadcasting
02 Pandas
Pandas is a library that is very good at managing tabular data. It can even read the Json format. Pandas is built on top of Numpy and thus is very fast. Pandas can be used to connect to a variety of sources for reading data. It also has a lot of summarisation, grouping and aggregation functions built into it. Here's what you'll learn in the following chapters:

Creating Dataframes
Maniupulation
Grouping
Data Types
Graphical Representations
Data Preprocessing using FIFA Dataset
03 Assigment
